# portfolio
In this portfolio, I have included a small sample of projects that I have worked on in order to exemplify my abilities. Each project was chosen to highlight specific skills.  
For example, the two files titled FinalProject, exhibit my statistical knowledge, my fluency with R and HLM7 statisticial programs, and my comfort with RMarkdown and integrating LaTex in RMarkdown.  
Diss1Social.py is a python script written for PsychoPy 2. I wrote this program for an experiment that included 3 conditions, movie stimuli, and recorded both response times and key presses.
