# portfolio
In this portfolio, I have included a small sample of projects that I have worked on in order to exemplify my abilities. Each project was chosen to highlight specific skills. Some data was simulated or taken from public data sources to keep the confidence of my project partners.    
For example, the two files titled FinalProject, exhibit my statistical knowledge, my fluency with R and HLM7 statisticial programs, and my comfort with RMarkdown and integrating LaTex in RMarkdown.  
Diss1Social.py is a python script written for PsychoPy 2. I wrote this program for an experiment that included 3 conditions, movie stimuli, and recorded both response times and key presses.  
SampleStatsModels.R is a script in which I simulated data for a theoretical experiment. I construct a series of models to conduct general analyses, spotlight analyses, and floodlight analyses. I also create a visualization using ggplot2.
