# Meet Me
I am a cognitive scientist and cognitive psychologist with more than 6 years of experience. I am highly skilled in experimental design, data analytics, and analysis with particular insight in human factors and user experience research. I have additional expertise in data-driven decision-making, cognitive marketing, and educational technology.

# Portfolio
In this portfolio, I have included a small sample of projects that I have worked on in order to exemplify my abilities. Each project was chosen to highlight specific skills. The data was either simulated or taken from public sources to keep the confidence of my project partners. This project also demonstrates my ability to clearly convey information to those with a background in statistics. 

SampleStatsModels.R - this is a script in which I simulated data for a theoretical experiment. I not only constructed a series of models to conduct general analyses, spotlight analyses, and floodlight analyses, but also interpret the meanings of each model in a meaningful way. Additionally, I created a visualization using ggplot2.
 
FinalProject (both files) - this project was included to exhibit my statistical knowledge, my fluency with R and HLM7 statisticial programs, and my comfort with RMarkdown and integrating LaTex in RMarkdown.  

Diss1Social.py - this is a python script written for PsychoPy 2. I wrote this program for an experiment that included 3 conditions, embedded movie stimuli, and recorded both response times and key press values.

ExampleDeliverableScript.R - this is an R script that was written for a client to use over again. The client had little knowledge of R and was able to replicate the analyses and figures that I had conducted on the next iterateration of data. The script is heavily commented to ensure the client was successful. 

Lalchandani Dissertation.pdf - this is exactly what it seems to be, my final dissertation. It can also be found at https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/s4655g713. I have included my dissertation to highlight my writing acumen and my ability to take complex methods and analyses and convey them clearly and fairly simply.
